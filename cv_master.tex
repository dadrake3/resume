   \resumeSubItem{Virtual Reality Cadaver Lab}
      {Over the course of a two semester senior design class, I worked with JUMP labs on campus to develop a VR visualization tool for 3d models of human anatomy generated from patient MRI and CT data. We used VR toolkit and unity along with an HTC vive to develop our VR environment, we then imported the 3d segmentation models created in FOVIA. Our project is still being actively developed at JUMP and is in plans to be used to train medical students at the new Engineering College of Medicine at UIUC. }
    \resumeSubItem{AIAA tech project team leader}
      {After joining AIAA in 2017, I joined the team working on mounting a 360 degree HD camera on a drone with a 3D printed a vibration dampening mount. We presented this project at Engineering Open House 2017. I then worked to transition the team towards creating a live head-tracking unit for the drone. With an Arduino nano and a 9-axis IMU, sensor fusion via the Madgwick algorithm is performed in real time to account for accelerometer noise, gyroscopic drift, and soft/ hard iron interference so as to produce accurate pitch and yaw values for the headset. These values are then used to remotely control a 2 axis camera gimbal mounted on an RC plane which then transmits a live camera feed to the wearer so as to give a live first person view while operating the plane. Presented at Engineering Open House 2018. Now, In my third year on the team I am one of the two team leaders and we hope to keep advancing our FPV capabilities.}
    \resumeSubItem{Personal and Professional Web Development with AWS}
      {I have used angular in conjunction with AWS to create a reusable gallery website template. I used AWS S3 to host the site as well as for image storage, AWS Cloudfront and Route53 were used to handling custom domain routing and content delivery. AWS Codepipeline and Codebuild were used to create continuous integration from a github repository. I also created a python script for quickly uploading the images to the S3 storage bucket, including metadata such as image titles and descriptions. With this template I was able to easily deploy my own personal photography website as well as an architectural gallery site. Furthermore, I used some aspects of my AWS stack to create a continuously integrated personal landing page. }

    \resumeSubItem{LED Train Sign}
      {Through SSH and a headless Raspberry Pi, I am developing an led sign in  Python and C, which will display train times for a given station or radius for the Chicago L, will display the weather, and will have a variety of other features such as party mode and beat tracking / equalizer. This project also required(s) significant modification and optimization of the Rasbian OS via low level linux operations. }
    \resumeSubItem{Rap Guru}
      {Used python and the rap genius API to create Markov chain models for generating rap lyrics that sound similar to a given artist. Developed novel heuristics to combine similar artists models in order to solve the problem that some artists lyric bases were just not large enough to support a realistic markov chain. Used AWS and Angular to build a website wrapper for my custom API implemented in API Gateway and AWS Lambda. }
     \resumeSubItem{Unity Game Development}
      {Created and hosted through github 5 different webGL games with the unity game engine and C\# . Utilized programmatic generation of terrains and obstacles as well as modified AI controls of game objects. One game under active development is an endless snowboarding game using real physics and a completely programmatically generated terrain. }
      \resumeSubItem{Classroom Projects}
      {Developed from scratch a linux based operating system for the x86 32 bit intel architecture. Implemented all core OS functionality such as system calls, user code execution, task scheduling, memory management, paging, video memory mapping, exception and interrupt handling. This was for my ECE 391 final project. I also wrote a Tetris clone from scratch, completely implemented in hardware via system verilog and an Altera FPGA board. Our project included all the hardware VGA mapping as well as hardware based game logic. For the same class I also implemented the LC3 CPU in system verilog on an FPGA. This project was for ECE 385. }
